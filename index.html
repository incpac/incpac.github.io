          <p class="summary">I&rsquo;ll admit I have a motivation problem. I have real trouble seeing something through in a timely manner. I only started working on the second prototype of my midi controller last weekend. Version one was complete 10 months ago. I had the idea for it 14 months before that. Hell, the subject of this post was finalized and implemented a month ago. I&rsquo;m starting this on the 11th but it&rsquo;s probably gonna end up being a couple of weeks before it actually gets published.</p>

          <p class="summary">Okay, I&rsquo;ll admit; I am shit at updating this site&hellip; blog&hellip; thing&hellip; Whatever, today we&rsquo;re going to build something cool; centralized SSH authentication using Hashicorp&rsquo;s Vault. We&rsquo;re going to stand up a Vault server and use it to generate One-Time-Passwords for SSHing (totaly a word) onto other servers.
Why? That&rsquo;s actually a good question. Honestly, PAM just seems like a shitfest to set up and maintain.
All right, I might be biased towards Hashicorp products.</p>

Create API Key The Hubot interface needs access to the Slack API. This is granted through a bot API token.
 Log into Slack via the web portal and browse to new bot page.</p>
