Ever since I started studying system administration, one of my many interersts was in virtualzation. After 
I came accros the MCSE: Private Cloud I knew I wanted this certification. My tutor at the time told me that 
this cert has very little practicle use in New Zealand, so I kind of pushed it to the back burner. 

Now after being in the industry for 18 months I've seen a few companies use specific parts of System Center 
in their environments. While they may not be using it in the private cloud arrangement, it still makes the 
certification seem worth while for the experience with the various components of it.

This project is an admittedly very slow build-log as I work torwards setting up a private cloud as to aid in 
my study towards the certification. As you can probably figure, it should not be used as a guide for setting 
up anything close to a production system. It is only meant as a method to get experience with the different 
components of System Center.
